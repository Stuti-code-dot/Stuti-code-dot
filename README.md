## About Me

I specialize in building and deploying **production-grade AI systems** that combine the depth of research with real-world impact. My work spans **biomedical AI**, **generative AI**, and **time-series forecasting** â€” always with a strong focus on scalability, explainability, and deployment.

Whether it's deploying transformer pipelines for early cancer detection, forecasting demand across 2M+ retail SKUs, or automating contract analysis with RAG and SHAP, I care deeply about **solving real problems with elegant machine learning systems**.

## Core Focus Areas

- **GenAI + LLMs**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Hugging Face, LangChain, contract Q&A systems, MiniGPT distillation  
- **Forecasting**: ARIMA, fbProphet, LSTM, XGBoost for energy, retail, and shipment demand prediction  
- **Biomedical AI**: Signal anomaly detection, genomic ML pipelines, implant telemetry algorithms, SHAP-based explainability  
- **MLOps & Deployment**: Airflow, Docker, GitHub Actions, MLflow, Power BI, AWS (SageMaker, Lambda), Azure ML
